# Log into the [AVAnnotate application](https://avannotate.netlify.app) with your GitHub credentials
For bulk uploading projects, please use the following templates. The Event and Tags (optional) templates represent the whole project. Each AV “event” must be listed on the Event spreadsheet. Each tag used in the project is listed on the Tags spreadsheet. Once the project is built, an Annotations spreadsheet is uploaded for each event. 
## PLEASE NOTE: For a successful upload, ALL CELLS in the columns used should be filled out in the following spreadsheets.

# [Event Spreadsheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1noYKA8DFaHkSLq-MXSPwCccY3YFeyR52/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=112492510360958259862&rtpof=true&sd=true)
This template organizes the events in a project and associates the AV files with that event. An “event” might be an interview, an oral history, a performance, a speech, a reading, or a conference that takes place over multiple days. (This list is not exhaustive, and the audiovisual material you’re working with may or may not fall into one of these “event” categories.)   
Each row in the Event template corresponds to one recording, though events can span multiple rows (e.g., the event “Interview 2” may be found on Tapes 2 and 3, so “Interview 2” will appear in two separate rows in the template). 

**Note:** 
If an event is associated with one AV file (audio or video), it will occupy one line on the spreadsheet. 
If an event has been recorded over multiple AV files (and you’re intending to include them in your AVAnnotate project), the event should appear in multiple lines of the spreadsheet. 

**Header**

Column A: Event Label (“Interview 1”)
Column B: Event Item Type (“Audio” or “Video”) 
Column C: AV File Label (name for the file; create a name even if there is not an AV URL)
Column D: AV File URL (optional)
Column E: Event Citation (optional)
Column F: Event Description (optional)

# [Tag Spreadsheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LOuw5aiF4v00Ivx3S-ozPcGHzeZf3ovz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112492510360958259862&rtpof=true&sd=true)
This template contains tags and tag categories used in a project. Tags are labels used in the interface to index, organize, and discover topics in the annotations. Categories can be used to organize the tags in groups. For instance, tags might contain the names of speakers featured on the recording(s), which could be organized via the category “speaker.” This would allow end users to easily find all annotations that relate to a given speaker or all speakers. 
Tags could also be used to organize concepts, themes, or features that appear across several recordings (e.g., “Shouting” as a tag and “Tone of Voice” as a category). Consistency with the spelling and capitalization of tags is imperative, as AVAnnotate will read each tag individually and cannot control for differences in case or spelling. 

**Note:** 
A tag can belong to multiple categories. For example, the tag “Zora Neale Hurston” may be found in the categories “Speaker” and “Topic” (depending on the event context) or may not be categorized at all. 
A single tag can contain multiple words and punctuation, but should not use colons or pipes (e.g., “Allende Gossens, Salvador, 1908-1973”).

# [Annotation Spreadsheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12yn6zxviUpNLYESlGfUyWTc83wmFfsOM/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=112492510360958259862&rtpof=true&sd=true)
This template includes project annotations. Annotations correspond to a given start and end point in the audio or video artifact, and contain information about the media. The nature of this information is entirely up to the user. For example, annotations might include a transcript; captions; information about formal features of the media, like shot sequence, volume, or lighting; historical or cultural context; environmental noises such as fans or car horns; or conceptual notes or themes. 
Annotations are linked to an event as part of the upload process. 

**Note:** 
Annotations may overlap in time and will appear in sequence in the interface according to the earliest start time.

**Header**

Column A: Start Time is an annotation’s start time in minutes and seconds <br>
Column B: End Time is an annotation’s end time, may be the same as start time for a point in time <br>
Column C: Annotation (e.g., transcription, notes on environmental sounds, formal features, etc.) <br>
Column D: Tags are pipe | separated; if a tag belongs to multiple categories, include the category like so: “category: tag | tag | tag | category: tag” (e.g., “People: Allende Gossens, Salvador, 1908-1973 | Presidents: Allende Gossens, Salvador, 1908-1973 | Frei Montalva, Eduardo, 1911-1982 | Pinochet Ugarte, Augusto, 1915-2006”) <br>
Column E: AV Label (optional if there is only one AV recording; mandatory if there is more than one AV recording) 

**Note:** 
The “pipe” can be found on QWERTY keyboards to the right of the letter “P.”
